JERRY:
This is how you operate?
GEORGE:
Yeah, I wish.
JERRY:
Let me just wipe the sink.
KRAMER:
(stands up from the couch and yells.) WHY EVEN GIVE HER AN OPTION FOR? (Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; to George, while pointing to the mattress) It's unbelievable.
GEORGE:
Yeah.
KRAMER:
...How's the real estate-business?
GEORGE:
...(surprised he asked) It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? Did you need something.
KRAMER:
Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
GEORGE:
Well, I might be getting in to that.
KRAMER:
(slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!
GEORGE:
I'm aware of you, all right, let's go (opens the bathroom door), let's go! (Jerry and the dog come out) You're on stage in 25 minutes.
(Comedy club.)
JERRY:
The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world, it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, 'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been in a situation, when I thought to myself- "I could use a cotton-ball right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they're like peat-moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two or three, that look like they've been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town- "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure. Let's face it- a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job-interview is- not many job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end of it...ya know- "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the people you'll be workin' with?".
(Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura)
JERRY:
Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's thinking?
GEORGE:
What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she's thinkin'.
JERRY:
Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective- I've gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.
GEORGE:
Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.
JERRY:
Really? How?
GEORGE:
'Cause it's all in the greeting.
JERRY:
Uh-huh.
GEORGE:
All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a good sign.
JERRY:
Right.
GEORGE:
Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is good.
JERRY:
"Lip-area".
GEORGE:
Ya know a hug- definitely good.
JERRY:
Hug is definitely good.
GEORGE:
Sure.
