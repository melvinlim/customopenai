JERRY:
...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got it (takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on) ten-fifteen...No, don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no, it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. (hangs up the phone; to Kramer-) I, I don't believe it...That, that was her. She wants to stay here!
(Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy mattress)
JERRY:
If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (talks from now on like he has a cigarette in his mouth) Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to come down.
GEORGE:
Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in an extra guy too? (sits down)
JERRY:
(hands George a beer) Look, it's a very awkward situation, I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.
GEORGE:
All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the EXACT phrasing of the request?
JERRY:
All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...
GEORGE:
A decent hotel-room...
JERRY:
Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.
GEORGE:
You can't be serious. This is New York city- there must be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? (waves with his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!
JERRY:
(cynical) This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, where were you yesterday?
GEORGE:
I think I was affected by the caffeine. (suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch) HO, HO, HO, GOOD DOG (etc.)
KRAMER:
(walks in behind the dog and closes the door) He really likes you, George.
GEORGE:
(ironically) Well, that's flattering.
KRAMER:
(the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking from the toilet) Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. (sees the mattress on the floor) Is this for that girl?
JERRY:
Yeah.
KRAMER:
Why even give her an option?
JERRY:
This is a person I like, it's not- "How to score on spring break".
GEORGE:
Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get a ticket.
JERRY:
Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the bathroom.
GEORGE:
So what? That's good.
JERRY:
Now, how could that be good?
GEORGE:
Because filth is good...Whatta you think- rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a woman comin' over- "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.
