JERRY:
(upset) Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! (actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer" wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!) I taped the game, it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.
KRAMER:
Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...(takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets) You got any meat?
JERRY:
(a little irritated) Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! (Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in) Well what, what happened in the game anyway?
KRAMER:
(still with his head in the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! (takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it) Ya know, I almost wound up going to that game.
JERRY:
(cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't been out of the building in ten years!
KRAMER:
Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks-) Are you done with this?
JERRY:
No.
KRAMER:
(glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table) When you're done, let me know.
JERRY:
Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.
KRAMER:
I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
JERRY:
No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I misread the whole thing.
KRAMER:
You want me to talk to her?
JERRY:
I don't think so.
KRAMER:
Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer. (shows with his fingers how close it was)
JERRY:
That close, huh?
KRAMER:
You better believe it. (The phone rings. Jerry picks it up)
JERRY:
Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.
KRAMER:
Give me it...let me talk to her (continues this way).
JERRY:
(gestures Kramer to shut up) No believe me, I'm always up at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane get in?...I got my friend George to take me...(Kramer suddenly notices something in the Mets-game on TV)...
KRAMER:
A SLIDE!...Wow!
