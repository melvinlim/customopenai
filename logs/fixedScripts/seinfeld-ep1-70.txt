JERRY:
Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
GEORGE:
That's so brutal, I hate that.
JERRY:
Ya know how they do that?
GEORGE:
That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.
JERRY:
Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
GEORGE:
Hand-sandwich.
JERRY:
Right.
GEORGE:
I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes...(suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry's eyes)
LAURA:
Guess who?
JERRY:
Hey, hey.
LAURA AND JERRY:
Heeeey! (they take each others hands like they're planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled)
JERRY:
It's good to see you.
LAURA:
Hi.
JERRY:
This is my friend George.
LAURA:
(shakes George's hand) Hi, how nice to meet you.
GEORGE:
Hi, how are you?
JERRY:
This is Laura.
GEORGE:
Laura, sure.
JERRY:
(to Laura) I can't believe you're here.
GEORGE AND
