JERRY:
Oh, I get it, this is about the button.
GEORGE:
(The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his note-block) Claire, Claire, you're a woman, right?
CLAIRE:
What gave it away, George?
GEORGE:
Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.
JERRY:
(to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?
GEORGE:
(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says she has to (makes some gestures to accent "has to") come to New York on business...
JERRY:
Oh you are beautiful! (ironically)
GEORGE:
and, and maybe (again some gestures) she'll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?
CLAIRE:
I'd have to say- uuhh, no. (George shows his note-block to Jerry, it says very largely- NO)
GEORGE:
(to Claire) So why did she call?
CLAIRE:
To be polite.
GEORGE:
To be polite, I rest my case.
JERRY:
Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking about, now, come on, come with me (stands up), I, I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.
GEORGE:
I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
JERRY:
Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".
GEORGE:
Come on, I'm tired.
CLAIRE:
(to Jerry) Don't worry, I gave him a little caffeine- he'll perk up.
GEORGE:
(takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics) Right, I knew I felt something...! (Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away with a smile)
(Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers)
GEORGE:
Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin'-...this is the dullest moment I've ever experienced. (walks away from the dryer; a man passes George and Jerry)
JERRY:
Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's got- detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first load.
GEORGE:
I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the city, I feel so cramped...
JERRY:
And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
GEORGE:
What?!
JERRY:
Laura.
GEORGE:
I can't believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!
JERRY:
Yeah, but how could you be so sure?
GEORGE:
(gets up) 'Cause it's signals, Jerry (starts snapping his fingers), it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?
JERRY:
No.
GEORGE:
She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It's Saturday night!
