JERRY:
Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.
GEORGE:
(with a big smile) So, ya know, what, what happened?
JERRY:
Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but it was great.
GEORGE:
Oh, nothing happened, but it was...
JERRY:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
This is great!
JERRY:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!
JERRY:
Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we'll get together.
GEORGE:
(whistles disapproving) Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had to come in"?
JERRY:
Yeah, but...
GEORGE:
"Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"? "Had to" and "Maybe"?
JERRY:
Yeah!
GEORGE:
No...no...no, I hate to tell you this- you're not gonna see this woman.
JERRY:
(indignant) What, are you serious...why, why did she call?
GEORGE:
How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.
JERRY:
To be polite? You are insane!
GEORGE:
All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you wanna know why she called you?
JERRY:
Yes!
GEORGE:
You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan of contingency!
