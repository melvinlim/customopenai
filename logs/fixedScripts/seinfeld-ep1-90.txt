JERRY:
You're engaged? (still can't believe it)
LAURA:
Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of "we", uh, it's a very stressful situation.
JERRY:
You're engaged! (like he's answering his own question)
LAURA:
Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...
JERRY:
Yeah.
LAURA:
You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on that boat.
JERRY:
Me too!

I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really is- we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that, we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks- (imitates horn).
