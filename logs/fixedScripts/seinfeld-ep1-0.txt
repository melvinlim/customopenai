JERRY:
You know, why we're here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin' to find us, they don't know where we are. (imitates one of these people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone) "Did you ring?, I can't find him." (imitates other person on phone) "Where did he go?" (the first person again) "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone out. You wanna go out- you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're staring around, whatta you do? You go- "We gotta be getting back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.
(Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a table.)
JERRY:
Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. (talking about George's shirt) The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it- it's too high! It's in no-man's-land, you look like you live with your mother.
GEORGE:
Are you through? (kind of irritated)
JERRY:
You do of course try on, when you buy?
GEORGE:
Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall considering the buttons.
JERRY:
Oh, you don't recall?
GEORGE:
(pretends he's talking into a microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.
JERRY:
Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it. (a waitress approaches the table)
WAITRESS:
Mister Seinfeld. (she pours coffee in his cup) Mister Costanza. (she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her)
GEORGE:
Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?
WAITRESS:
It's missing, I have to do it in my head- decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it's very challenging work. (ironically)
JERRY:
Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional waitress.
WAITRESS:
Trust me George- no one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine. (she pours the coffee and walks away)
GEORGE:
How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
JERRY:
Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.
GEORGE:
Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?
JERRY:
I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?
GEORGE:
No, you didn't!
JERRY:
I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...(looks in the milk can) There's no milk in here, what...
GEORGE:
Wait wait wait, what is she, (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) what is she like?
