JERRY:
Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. (they pick up the bags)
LAURA:
Oh, thank you.
JERRY:
(privately to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?
GEORGE:
Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That wasn't in the manual, I don't know.
(Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment)
JERRY:
So uh, what do ya think?
LAURA:
Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.
JERRY:
Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?
LAURA:
(laughs) Actually uhm, do you have any wine?
JERRY; Uh, yeah, I think I do.
LAURA:
Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? (points to the lamp)
JERRY:
Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. (she turns down the lamp)
LAURA:
Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wondering- would it be possible, and if it's not, fine, for me to stay here tomorrow night too?
JERRY:
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' anything?
LAURA:
No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I'm right open.
JERRY:
Really? What would you like to do?
LAURA:
Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.
JERRY:
(doubtfully) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pours the wine) I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. (the phone rings; he picks it up) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Uhm, it's for you.
LAURA:
(she takes the phone) Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, bye (she hangs up the phone). Never get engaged.
JERRY:
You're engaged?
LAURA:
You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.
