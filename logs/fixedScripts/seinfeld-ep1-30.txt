JERRY:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
What is that? It's ridiculous! (Jerry bobs agreeingly) You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! (snaps his fingers again) Signal!
JERRY:
Maybe you're right.
GEORGE:
Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
JERRY:
This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.
GEORGE:
(puts an arm around Jerry and whispers) I know, I know. (normal voice) Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't you just see if it's dried?
JERRY:
No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.
GEORGE:
You're gonna "overdry" it.
JERRY:
You, you can't "overdry".
GEORGE:
Why not?
JERRY:
Same as you can't "overwet". (George looks puzzled) You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead- like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and I shoot you- you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".
GEORGE:
(looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to them pointing to Jerry) Any questions?
JERRY:
How could she not tell me where she was staying? (George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it- the dryer stops working and George closes the lid)
GEORGE:
(points to the dryer) Look at that- they're done! It's a miracle! (Jerry looks surprised)
(Comedy club)
JERRY:
"Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the live of clothes. It is...no, think about it- the washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs the underwear- "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by, you open up the lid and they'll- (shows how clothes are acting when you open the lid)...Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they're in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers...the dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper, the night before- (sock's voice) "Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm goin'...you wait here!" The dryer-door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. They hope you don't see him and then he goes down the road (shows how the sock is going down the road). They got buttons sewed on their faces- join the puppet show...So they're showing me on television the detergent for getting out blood-stains...Is this a violent image to anybody? Blood-stains? I mean, I, come on, you got a T-shirt with blood-stains all over it, maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem right now...Maybe you oughta get the harpoon out your chest first.
(Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV)
JERRY:
(The phone rings. He picks it up and says-) If you know what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it, hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah, no (somebody knocks at the door) Yeah? (to the door, while still at the phone)
KRAMER:
(enters) Are you up?
JERRY:
(To Kramer) Yeah...(in the phone) Yeah, people do move! Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem (hangs up the phone).
KRAMER:
Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
