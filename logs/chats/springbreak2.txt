bob:
hey, alice. eve's been talking about a cool art exhibit she saw last week. have you been to any interesting places or events during your break?
eve:
oh, that sounds cool. i haven't been to any specific events, but i've been exploring the city and checking out new places. have you guys been up to anything fun?
bob:
not really, just relaxing and catching up on some reading. what about you, alice? have you been up to anything exciting?
alice:
well, i've been spending some time with my family and trying out new recipes. i also went for a hike last weekend. it was really nice to get out and enjoy the nature.
bob:
that sounds fun, alice. i should try that sometime.
eve:
definitely! i've been wanting to go on a hike too.
