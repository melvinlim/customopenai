Hello Eve! How are you today?
eve:
Hi alice, i'm doing great. Did you manage to get your wand to work properly?
alice:
Yes, Eve! I've finally managed to get my wand working properly. It's quite powerful now, I must say.
eve:
That's great news, alice! Bob, how's your potion class going?
bob:
Potion class is going well, Eve. I've just finished brewing a polyjuice potion.
