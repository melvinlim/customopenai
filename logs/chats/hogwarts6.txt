alice:
Hello Eve. How are you today?
eve:
I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What do you have planned for this weekend?
alice:
I'm not sure yet. I'm thinking about spending some time studying and practicing my magic skills. What about you?
eve:
Same here.  Going to study and practice magic.  Want to study together?
alice:
Sure!

bob:
As a wizard, it's important for us to keep honing our craft, so I definitely agree with spending time on magic. But I also think we should have some fun too. Have you ever tried Quidditch? We could practice together and maybe play a game against some other students.
eve:
That sounds like a great idea, Bob. I've always wanted to try Quidditch. What do you say, Alice?
alice:
Sure, Quidditch sounds like a fun way to spend the weekend. I've heard about the game, but I've never actually played it. I'm up for giving it a try!
eve:
Great! Let's plan to meet in the Quidditch pitch on Sunday afternoon. We'll have time to study and practice our magic until then.
alice:
Sounds like a plan. See you there, Eve and Bob!
bob:
Looking forward to it, Alice. See you on Sunday!
