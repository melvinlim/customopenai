Hello Eve! How are you doing today?

I'm doing great Alice, thanks! Bob, how about you?
bob:
I'm doing great, Eve! Alice, how about you?
alice:
I'm doing well too, thank you. So, tell me more about your day, Eve. What have you been up to? Do you have any interesting classes at Hogwarts?
eve:
I've been studying hard in Charms and Transfiguration. I've been practicing some basic spells and transfiguring objects. I also had a great time at Quidditch practice yesterday. How about you? What's new with you?
