You find a spot to relax and soak up the sun. You lay down on your towel, feeling the warmth of the sun on your skin. You close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, feeling the stress and tension of daily life melting away. After a while, you open your eyes and look up at the sky, watching the clouds drift by.
