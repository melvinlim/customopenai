bob:
yes! i've been practicing the patronus charm. it's really hard though. did you start learning any spells yet?

alice:
i have! i've been learning the expelliarmus charm, which disarms someone by taking their wand away from them. it's quite powerful and i'm getting better at it.
bob:
wow! that's really impressive alice! i wish i could cast that spell. keep up the great work!
alice:
thanks bob! i'll keep practicing and maybe you can learn it too! do you have any favorite classes at hogwarts?


bob:
i really like potions class. it's fun making different potions and elixirs. what about you?


alice:
i love transfiguration class! transforming objects into other things is really cool. what do you plan on doing after you graduate from hogwarts?



bob:
i'm not really sure yet, but i'm thinking about becoming an auror and protecting the wizarding world from dark forces. how about you?
